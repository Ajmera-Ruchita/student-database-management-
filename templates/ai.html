    Machine learning is about extracting knowledge from the data. It can be defined as,
    
    Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which enables machines to learn from past data or experiences without being explicitly programmed.
    Machine learning enables a computer system to make predictions or take some decisions using historical data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning uses a massive amount of structured and semi-structured data so that a machine learning model can generate accurate result or give predictions based on that data.
