     What is Python...!!</center></h1> <br> <br>
 <h2 style="font-size:30px;">  Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites
    and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a 
    general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety 
    of different programs and isnâ€™t specialized for any specific problems.
    This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one
    of the most-used programming languages today..</h2>
